Project Settings (In Debug/Release Mode)
- Run the engine with HighOctane_Main project, set as startup project.
- In Debug mode, it will run the debug editor, showing FPS and the ImGui perfomance panel, debug diagnostics information, and custom DEBUG_PRINT macros on to console.
- In Release mode, it will run the release editor, all the debug functions will be void to speed up the execution.

Project Settings (In Game mode x64)
- Will compile the final game product in fullscreen mode. Do not need to change any settings in the source code. This mode directly runs the game and does not compile any of the level editor codes and debug codes.

Different Projects:
1. HighOctane_CustomEngine
	- Project that will create a static library (.lib). It contains the code and functionalities for our custom engine such as Entity Component System (ECS), Script Engine, Physics, Collision.

2. HighOctane_LevelEditor
	- Project that will create a static library (.lib). It contains the code for the level editor using ImGui.

3. HighOctane_Main
	- Project is an application(.exe). This project contains the code to initialize the systems and run the systems such as the game loop. This project will use the aforementioned library projects to run. For example, running in "Game" x64 mode would not compile any of the Level editor codes as it is not needed.
