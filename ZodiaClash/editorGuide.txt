Editing System:
- Prefabs can be edited through the prefab editor window
- Within the viewport,(if it is not locked by the layering system) selecting an entity would have a green box highlighted around it, means it is editable.
- Resize it by hovering over the corners or sides and dragging. It would increase or decrease the scale.
- Drag the editable entity anywhere on screen.
- Object Snapping Guide lines will appear as you drag objects around the scene.
- The object that you are moving will snap when it comes near any other object - center to current object's center, top to current object's bottom, bottom to current object's top, left to current object's right, and right to current object's left, in that order of priority. When the 2 objects are centered, a tool tip with the word "Center" will appear, and when the 2 objects are snapped in 2 directions (x and y), a tool tip with the word "Intersect" will appear.
- Toggle on/off the Snapping Guide in "Options > Turn Off Snapping Guide". (Snapping Guides and Tilemap editor are mutually exclusive. Both can be turned off at the same time. Turning one on will turn off the other.)
================================================================

Tilemap Editor:
- In the Tilemap Control panel, check the checkbox to Turn on the Tilemap Editor. (Snapping guides and Tilemap editor are mutually exclusive. Both can be turned off at the same time. Turning one on will turn off the other.)
- A grid will appear in the viewport.
- In the Tilemap Control panel, you can adjust the X width, Y height, and offset values of the grid.
- Offset shifts the grid from -50% to +50% for fine grained control.
- You can also lock both the X and Y axes to have the same values for grid spacing and offset.
- Below the sliders, is the Snap-to-corner selection where you can select which corner of the grid you want your "tile" to snap to.
- In the last section of the Tilemap Control Panel, you can automatically resize the grid width and height to the dimensions of the selected object. Even if the object is rotated, clicking the buttons will automatically resize the grid to the exact fit of the object. Note that this function only works when only 1 object is selected. (Multiple selected objects is not supported for this)
- Finally, you can also resize the object to the grid's width or height (aspect ratio will be maintained), by right-clicking on the selected object, and choosing Scale to Grid Width or Height. There is also a function to resize the object to fit into the grid's width and height without maintaining aspect ratio, but will only be available if the object's rotation is 0 (ie, no rotation).
